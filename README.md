# acinfinityhomeassistantcard

This is my first repository so forgive me if I'm doing it wrong. I basically made three folders with the code I used for my Home Assistant card. I use the card two different ways, as a popup card and as a regular card. The reason I use the decluttering card is because I have more than one AC Infinity controller so the declutterring card allows me to write the code once and then send variables to it depending on which one I use. I use several custom cards. I will try to list them as I have time.
