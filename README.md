# acinfinityhomeassistantcard

This is my first repository so forgive me if I'm doing it wrong. I basically made four folders with the code I used for my Home Assistant card. I use the card two different ways, as a popup card and as a regular card. The reason is I have a page with a shortened dashboard card (which I do not show the code for). It's basically the same dashboardcard but shortened to only show the three gauges and the click for popup function. You could obviouosly change it on how you see fit. The reason I use the decluttering card is because I have more than one AC Infinity controller so the declutterring card allows me to write the code once and then send variables to it depending on which one I use. I use several custom cards. I will try to list them as I have time.
